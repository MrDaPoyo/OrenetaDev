# Oreneta Browser
> Oreneta is a small, fast browser that works inside the Ucanet network.
> It implements an AI exclusively created to provide the best results with natural 
queries like if you were asking a real person. For example:
### ```Hey Oreneta, what's that retro ol' looking cool website where I can find plenty of information about history? ```
> [wikipedia.com](https://wikipedia.com)

## How to use it

Just grab the url-list.txt file and input all the url you want, separated by lines, then execute traning.py and finally main.py!
